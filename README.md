# 🚗 Second Hand Car Dealer
The Second Hand Car Dealer project is a real-world data analysis project built using MySQL and a CSV dataset (Car dekho.csv). The goal of the project is to simulate a used car dealership platform from a data perspective, performing deep insights through SQL queries.

This project simulates a Second Hand Car Dealer platform, where:
- Sellers can list used cars for sale
- Buyers can browse and search listings
